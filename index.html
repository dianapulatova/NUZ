          TYPOGRAPHY, even when poorly executed, can never be taken for granted;
          nor is it ever accidental. Indeed, beauti- fully typeset pages are
          always the result of long experience. Now and then they even attain
          the rank of great artistic achievement. But the art of typesetting
          stands apart from ex- pressive artwork, because the appeal is not
          limited to a small circle. It is open to everyone's critical judgment,
          and nowhere does this judgment carry more weight. Typography that can-
          not be read by everybody is useless. Even for someone who constantly
          ponders matters of readability and legibility, it is difficult to
          determine whether something can be read with ease, but the average
          reader will rebel at once when the type is too small or otherwise
          irritates the eye; both are signs of a certain illegibility already.
